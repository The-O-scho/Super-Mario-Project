\noindent \textbf{STAT 333 Final Project}  \\
\textbf{Student:} Duc Huy Nguyen (Thomas), Theo Schouten \\
\textbf{Date:} \today \\
\textbf{Subject:} Deliverable 2, Descriptive Statistical Analysis

\vspace{1em}

\noindent \textbf{Overview:} \\
This paper summarizes our preliminary findings of the dataset in order to serve two perposes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Predicting whether a given Super Mario run will be the new world record (WR)
    \item Predicting when top speed runners will be able to reach the theoretical tool-assisted speedrun time.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Descriptive Statistics and Key Findings} \\
Below is a summary of the key statistics around this study.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Summary statistics of key variables (mean, median, variance, ranges), including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Daily number of runs submitted
        \item Number of attempts by top runners
        \item Distribution of completion times
        \item Historical time gaps between world records
    \end{itemize}
    \item Visualizations used (not shown here but referenced):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Histogram of run submission counts
        \item Time-series plot of best run times over months/years
        \item Boxplot comparing run times of top 10 runners vs. the field
    \end{itemize}
    \item Identification of trends:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Whether record attempts cluster at certain periods
        \item How the frequency of record-breaking events changes over time
        \item Whether top-runner activity spikes before records
    \end{itemize}
    \item Initial correlations between predictors and the binary outcome (record vs. no record).
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Interpretation in Context} \\
In this model:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2em]
    \item We interpret which descriptive patterns suggest higher likelihood of a record.
    \item We explain how variables such as runner activity, submission volume, and historical progression
    reflect underlying skill improvements or luck factors.
    \item We highlight any surprising findings, such as long plateaus without records or sudden bursts of progress.
    \item We discuss data limitations (missing values, uneven sampling across years, changes in category rules).
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Recommendations:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2em]
    \item Which variables should be included in the predictive model based on descriptive insights.
    \item Whether transformations (log-scaling submissions, differencing times, etc.) appear necessary.
    \item Steps to clean or refine the dataset before modeling.
    \item Suggestions for improving predictive performance such as adding runner-specific features.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Appendix:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2em]
    \item \textbf{Model:}
\begin{verbatim}
# (Example placeholder code—replace with your R/Python descriptive analysis)
summary(data)
hist(data$submissions)
plot(data$date, data$best_time, type="l")
cor(data[, c("submissions","top_runner_attempts","record_flag")])
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}
