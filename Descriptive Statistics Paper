\noindent \textbf{STAT 333 Final Project}  \\
\textbf{Student:} Duc Huy Nguyen (Thomas), Theo Schouten \\
\textbf{Date:} \today \\
\textbf{Subject:} Deliverable 2, Descriptive Statistical Analysis

\vspace{1em}

\noindent \textbf{Overview:} \\
This paper summarizes our preliminary findings of the dataset in order to serve two perposes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Predicting whether a given Super Mario run will be the new world record (WR)
    \item Predicting when top speed runners will be able to reach the theoretical tool-assisted speedrun time.
\end{itemize}


\vspace{0.8em}

\noindent \textbf{Descriptive Statistics and Key Findings} \\
The datasets consists of two datasets:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first dataset records the World Record (WR) progression from the first WR ever recorded in June 25th, 2002 to the latest WR, which occurred October 22nd, 2025. It can be retrieved here: \url {https://www.speedrun.com/smb1/stats?h=Any-NTSC&x=w20p0zkn-onvvdymn.013zwgxq}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The first dataset contains the progression of the Super Mario Bros. Any\% (NTSC) World Record (WR), beginning with the earliest recorded WR on June 25, 2002 and continuing through the most recent WR on October 22, 2025. It can be accessed here: \url{https://www.speedrun.com/smb1/stats?h=Any-NTSC&x=w20p0zkn-onvvdymn.013zwgxq}
        \item The WR has been broken \textbf{46} times by \textbf{14} different players.
        \item The first recorded WR is \textbf{325 seconds} (5 minutes 25 seconds), set on June 25, 2002 by Aaron Collins. The current WR is \textbf{294.448 seconds} (4 minutes 54.448 seconds), set on October 22, 2025 by Niftski.
        \item The theoretical human-limit time, i.e., the fastest time a human could possibly achieve, is \textbf{294.032 seconds} (4 minutes 54.032 seconds).
        \item The current WR is \textbf{0.186 seconds} slower than the TAS (Tool-Assisted Speedrun) time, which corresponds to approximately \textbf{11 frames} at 60 frames per second.
        \item The median rate of WR improvement is \textbf{-0.00184 seconds per day}, while the most recent improvement rate is \textbf{-0.00243 seconds per day}.
        \item The WR improvement rate reflects a standard pattern of diminishing returns: as players approach the theoretical TAS limit, achieving further WR improvements becomes increasingly difficult. In other words, the remaining room for improvement steadily decreases.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The second dataset contains 1,353 attempts by the current WR holder, Niftski. Each attempt is split into eight major checkpoints, where 1 marks a successful completion and 0 marks a failure. The results at each checkpoint are then randomized. Refer to Table 1 in the Appendix for an overview of the data.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The table below shows Niftski's success rate at each major checkpoint. \\ \\
        \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
            \hline
            {Checkpoint} & {1-1} & {1-2} & {4-1} & {4-2} & {8-1} & {8-2} & {8-3} & {8-4} \\ \hline
            {Success} & {829} & {595} & {482} & {63} & {30} & {11} & {9} & {1} \\ \hline
            {$\mathbb{P}$(Success)} & {61.27\%} & {43.98\%} & {35.62\%} & {4.66\%} & {2.22\%} & {0.81\%} & {0.67\%} & {0.07\%} \\ \hline 
        \end{tabular} \\
        \item There are sharp decrease in the number of successful attempts at later checkpoints. For example, success falls from \textbf{482} at 4-1 to \textbf{63} at 4-2, an \textbf{87\%} decrease. There is also a \textbf{63\%} decrease between 8-1 and 8-2. A few factors can explain these drops:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item More pressure and stress in later stages, which can lead to mistakes.
            \item Higher difficulty in later stages, which increases the chance of errors.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Suggestion of Statistical Model} \\
We suggest several models that fit the goal of the project and the data:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2em]
    \item An ARIMA model that uses WR improvement over time (seconds per day) to predict when the WR will reach the TAS time.
    \item A model based on Niftski's dataset to predict whether a run will be a WR.
    \item Other possible models.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.8em}

\noindent \textbf{Limitations:}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.2em]
    \item Research on games like \emph{Super Mario Bros.} is limited, especially in academic settings. Because of this, data on the game and its time-attack attempts is limited.
    \item We do not have data from other competitive speedrunners and chose not to collect or publish any of their runs.
    \item We plan to address these limits by collecting data manually based on recorded results. These results are timed with reliable stopwatches to keep the measurements consistent.
\end{itemize}
